   - **Standardized route loading UI to use a spinner component.**
   - **Implemented dynamic page hero section and titles based on Sanity schema fields.**

5. Code Quality & Consistency
   - **Refactored `stripChars` to `stegaClean` in all relevant block components.**
   - **Resolved linter errors in `AdvancedListBlock.tsx` and `BentoBlock.tsx`.**
   - **Improved Sanity image query consistency for `carouselBlock`.**
   - **CSS and theme files (`globals.css`, `theme.css`, `_classes.ts`) updated to fix nested theme display issues.**

## What's Left to Build

1. Frontend Features
   - [x] Breadcrumbs
   - [x] Add a sanity live compatible CSP. A strong Content Security Policy (CSP) significantly reduces the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Learn how to use a CSP to prevent XSS (Initial implementation via middleware; nonce propagation pending)
   - [ ] The Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) can be used to isolate the top-level window from other documents such as pop-ups. Learn more about deploying the COOP header. (Consider after CSP is fully stable)
   - [x] The X-Frame-Options (XFO) header or the frame-ancestors directive in the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header control where a page can be embedded. These can mitigate clickjacking attacks by blocking some or all sites from embedding the page. Learn more about mitigating clickjacking. (Implemented via middleware: X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN and CSP frame-ancestors)
   - [x] update page titles and heros. these should be options on pages not blocks. (Hero section and page titles implemented based on page schema fields `showHero`, `hero`, `heading`, `title`, `subheading`)
   - [ ] Responsive design
   - [x] Performance optimization (Targeted: Slideshow mobile image sizing, Heading font sizes for API deprecation)
   - [x] SEO implementation
   - [x] ~~Unify image URL implementations~~ (Replaced by direct `next/image` usage)
   - [x] Refactor `OptimizedImage` to use `next/image` and `urlForImage` (Completed July 24, 2024)
   - [x] **Refactor `stripChars` to `stegaClean`** (Completed July 25, 2024 for all identified blocks)
   - [x] Add structured data to routes
   - [x] Add sitemap page route
   - [x] **Implement Footer component with dynamic data** (Completed July 25, 2024)
   - [x] **Standardize route loading UI to spinner** (Completed July 25, 2024)
   - [x] **Implement comprehensive backup system** (Completed - automated Sanity dataset and media backups)
   - [ ] Add a search page

## Current Status

- Project initialization complete
- Basic setup complete
- Core features implemented
- Breadcrumb navigation with structured data implemented
- ~~Image handling unified with `OptimizedImage.tsx` and `urlForImage` utility.~~ (Superseded by direct `next/image` refactor)
- All image handling refactored to use `next/image` directly with `urlForImage` utility; `OptimizedImage.tsx` removed.
- Fixed PortableText list item rendering issue by updating Sanity schema for block content.
- Added `next.config.mjs` with refined `deviceSizes` for image optimization.
- Resolved deprecated API warning for heading font sizes by updating `Heading.tsx`.
- Implemented initial set of security headers (CSP, XFO, etc.) via `middleware.ts`, configured for Sanity Live Preview and YouTube.
- **Resolved critical frontend steganography decoding error.**
- **Completed `stripChars` to `stegaClean` refactor for all identified block components.**
- **Successfully implemented and typed the `Footer.tsx` component.**
- **Resolved linter errors in `AdvancedListBlock.tsx` and `BentoBlock.tsx`.**
- **Standardized all route-level loading UIs to use a spinner.**
- **Integrated new Sanity page schema fields (`showHero`, `hero`, `heading`, `title`, `subheading`) into the frontend for dynamic hero section and page title display.**
- **CSS and theme files (`globals.css`, `theme.css`, `_classes.ts`) updated to fix nested theme display issues.**
- **Backup System Implementation Complete:**
  - Automated daily and monthly backups of Sanity dataset and all media assets
  - Vercel Blob Storage integration with automatic cleanup
  - Cron job scheduling via Vercel configuration (GET requests supported)
  - Secure API endpoint with token authentication
  - Environment variables properly configured for production deployment
  - CLI-compatible export format for full restoration

## Known Issues

1. Development

   - ~~**`stripChars` to `stegaClean` Refactor - Pending:**~~
     - ~~`nextjs-app/app/components/blocks/CallToActionBlock.tsx` still needs update.~~
     - ~~`nextjs-app/app/components/blocks/AdvancedListBlock.tsx` has linter errors post-refactor attempt.~~
   - The "token in browser" warning from Sanity persists, likely related to `defineLive.ts`. This is noted as a separate issue to investigate.
   - CSP: Nonce propagation from middleware to script tags is not yet implemented. This is critical for `script-src 'nonce-...'` to be effective and may lead to blocked scripts.
   - Visual Editing: "Unable to connect to visual editing" and related `postMessage` errors. Actively debugging.
   - **Webhook Creation:**
     - Direct API calls do not work (404 errors)
     - Need to verify correct Sanity CLI approach
     - Environment variables need to be configured
     - Script needs to be updated to use CLI if confirmed working
