Flood insurance, for example, is a stand-alone type of policy and, like homeowner’s insurance, is not included in general business insurance policies. Evaluating your business' risks in the event of a hurricane is necessary to prepare properly. You’ll need to be ready to secure your business long before the hurricane makes landfall, which may include boarding up windows, sealing any openings around doors and windows, and securing equipment. If supplies and equipment can be easily relocated, it is a good idea to do so. If not, a business interruption insurance add-on provides good protection, ensuring you can continue to operate even after heavy damage or loss. You also need to prepare your business much as homeowners secure their homes and properties. Make sure gutters and drains are free of debris, and that roofing is secured properly. Anchor any equipment or items that are outside, or move them indoors if possible. You will also want to ensure that computer data and files are backed up securely off-site and that any servers holding information are properly secured."}]},{"_type":"block","style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"Protecting your business this hurricane season begins with an understanding of your business’ risk.
